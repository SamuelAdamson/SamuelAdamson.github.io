        	I am from Grand Junction, Colorado, and I love the beautiful landscapes over on the Western Slope. I compete in powerlifting. Both my parents were also Computer Science Majors.
        	I am studying Computer Science because I think it will allow me to be a contributing member of society in a world that's becoming more and more digital everyday.
